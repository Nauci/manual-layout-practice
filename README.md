This is a practice project for manual layout.

Screen 1 - AViewController  
Mock: https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main#/console/14730748/306300834/preview    
Try to set up a view hierarchy that makes sense. Have the red box be the superview of the green, etc.

Screen 2 - BViewController  
Mock: https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main#/console/14730748/306300839/preview

Good luck!
